Submission for : http://www.mindsumo.com/contests/analyze-clicks-and-bounce-rates-from-online-couponers

Extra Credit Offered for Accomplishing the Following:

|Condition | Fulfillment|
|----------|------------|
|Multiple Languages| Python (2.7), Java|
|No 3rd Party Libraries | All Imports From Respective Libraries|

I decided to deliver the python implementation first, as the readability of the
language would provide me with a guide for implementation in a second language.

Please provide feedback if you notice a more efficient solution, I'm always looking
to improve my coding!
